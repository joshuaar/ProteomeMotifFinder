The shell scipts in this folder interact with NCBI site, grab fasta files, and 
format them

Most of these are not in use because I decided it was too complicated to keep
talking to the NCBI FTP site. I instead decided to keep a local copy of the
files I need and use these scripts to access those.

Most notably listJSON.sh lists out all the bacteria and viruses and puts the list
in ncbi_cache

Also grabFasta.py goes to ncbi_cache/OrgFastas and grabs the appropriate folder 
given in its only argument. It then formats all the fasta files as JSON and 
prints it to stdout, to be read by node.
